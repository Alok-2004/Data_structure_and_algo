Data Structure needed :-  
Priority Queue of pair < weight , destination > min heap
unordered_map


steps:-

- insert the pair <-1 , source> in Priority_queue
- one by one remove the root element of the Priority_queue 
- if the root Element is already visited , then we will just continue
- we mark the root visited
- We store the weight of the pair in the answ
- Update the mapping
- Go to every neighbour of the curr element, and only add those which are non visited and have a better weight proposition
